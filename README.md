This is a basic voting and bank system dapp created using solidity.

There are 2 contracts in this repo.

One named Voting.sol and the other named Bank.sol.

They can be found in /hardhat/contracts/Bank.sol and /hardhat/contracts/Voting.sol.


The proof that the tasks I was asked to work on has been solved, is present in the screenshots.

* interact.png, interact2.png, interact3.png are for this task -- "Perform basic actions like calling contract functions, reading contract state, and sending transactions."

* polia.png, sepolia.png, sepolia2.png are for this task -- "Deploy the smart contract to a test network, such as the Ethereum Sapolia testnet or a local development blockchain like Ganache."

* and finally the contract address.png is for the task -- "Verify that the contract is deployed successfully and obtain the contract address."
